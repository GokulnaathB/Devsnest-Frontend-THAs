        <p>Dear Sir,<br>
            I sincerely hope that you're doing all good.<br>
            Devsnest is a non-profit organization with the motto to make young India<br>
            financially self-sustainable by providng equal opportunity for all.</p>
        <p>
            They are organizing a 8 months long code camp wherein they teach us<br>
            DSA and Web Development. They make sure that we're company ready.
        </p>
        <p>
            Attending Devsnest's Code Camp will be a good learning experience for me.<br>
            I sincerely hope that you'll give me the permission to attend it.<br>
            Hoping for a positive response from you.
